# E Commerce Back-End

This project defines the backend code for a hypothetical e-commerce site. It creates mysql tables for categories, prodcuts, tags and product tags using the sequelize npm package. Tables have associations with each other so using a GET request will bring up the related data along with it. To try out the project, once cloned install the dependencies and use your preferred API request software (ex. Postman). 

Starter code was provided while I filled out the models and routes files.
